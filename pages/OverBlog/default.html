						The Brooklyn Nine-Nine actor loves Blizzard. He has visited Blizzard HQ. He has written about it on his blog. He has loudly proclaimed that Overwatch is his favorite video game. He has commented about it on Reddit. He has tweeted about it. He even got the Rock to tweet about it.</p>

                        <p>Overwatch’s new and 24th hero is the robot tank Orisa, who fights with a “fusion driver,” or a projectile machine gun. In a developer update video, Overwatch game developer Jeff Kaplan says her weapon has more range than nearly any other tank hero. She’s currently on the PTR.<br><br>
						The robot was created by the 11-year-old genius Efi Oladele, who crafted it from discarded defense robot parts in Numbani.</p>

						The most recent season of Overwatch Competitive Play has begun, and as usual, Blizzard has made some changes to the way that the game works in its ranked mode. First and foremost is the almost inevitable change to the Skill Rating system.</p>

                        <p>Given the success of Overwatch, and how it's captivated #Blizzard fans old and new, it isn't too surprising that a TV or film adaptation might be on the cards. Film and TV adaptations of video games are becoming increasingly common: Silent Hill and Resident Evil both became film franchises in their own right, while on the TV front Skylander's: Academy has just launched on Netflix, and we've even seen an anime series based off the video game series Danganronpa.</p>
