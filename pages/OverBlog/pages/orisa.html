                        <p>Overwatch’s new and 24th hero is the robot tank Orisa, who fights with a “fusion driver,” or a projectile machine gun. In a developer update video, Overwatch game developer Jeff Kaplan says her weapon has more range than nearly any other tank hero. She’s currently on the PTR.<br><br>
						The robot was created by the 11-year-old genius Efi Oladele, who crafted it from discarded defense robot parts in Numbani.<br><br>
						Orisa’s overview describes her as the “central anchor of her team,” who defends with a protective barrier. Her “fortify” ability allows her to reduce incoming damage, and her protective barrier shields allies, like Zarya. Her “Halt!” attack is a sort mini-graviton surge that allows her to pull enemies from around corners or slow them down. And her ultimate move is a supercharger that, when thrown, damage-boosts allies within line-of-sight.<br><br>						
						Kaplan describes Orisa as an “anchor tank.” “We wanted another tank that teams could build around or position around,” he explained.<br><br>						
						We’ll update with early impressions. She seems like a formidable, supporting tank who could make Reinhardt less essential to Overwatch’s meta.</p>
